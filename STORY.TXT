    Long ago, a princess and her family lived their lives in a peaceful land
which was known to all as Mesentry.  In the deep crevices of Mesentry lived
the underworld, an evil, dark world ruled by a wicked beast called Gordo.  The
item which kept a barrier that seperated the two contrasting worlds was called
the sacred emerald.  Only when the emerald was whole could the barrier be kept
unbroken. Without it, the underworld would almost surely take over the         
world...
    In a few days the princess was to be married to you.  All was well until
the king of the land informed the people that the sacred emerald was stolen.
He told them that he saw several creatures take it away and there was nothing
he could do to stop it.  The creatures from the underworld told him that they
would break the emerald into twelve pieces and put each piece in a seperate
castle.  The king knew that all the creatures from the underworld would soon
take over the overworld if they didn't get the pieces of the emerald back
together again.  You were outraged by this and were the only one that
volunteered to seek out the pieces to the sacred emerald.  The king gave you
100 gold and a dagger and sent you out on a long journey to restore
peace to the land of Mesentry... It's your destiny.  Good Luck!
